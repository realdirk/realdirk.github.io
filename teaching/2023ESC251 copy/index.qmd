description: | 
  An introduction to the concepts and techniques utilized in the analysis and design of robust control systems. Topics include a review of state-space control systems concepts; standard regulator problem; reduced order observers and state feedback controllers; optimal and robust control design methods; utilization of computer-aided optimal control systems design software such as MATLAB. Techniques developed will be applied, in the form of student design projects, to a variety of challenging control systems design problems.
