The goal of this project is to use drones as analogies and metaphors of physical systems. For instance, a drone can mimic the motion of a mass-spring system. While the drone is hovering in mid-air the user pulls it down to provide an initial displacement, and the drone starts oscillating with a frequency determined by the physical parameters of the mass-spring system. Similarly, multiple drones can be used to visualize standing and moving waves. 

Justin Rooney started this project as part of his M.Eng. thesis, [PDF](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2447804622?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true).

This project is now continued as a [VIP course](https://cooper.edu/academics/vertically-integrated-projects). Students Aymane Saissi, Amelia Chan, and Jason Chen, implemented a swarming drones demo that visualizes a tornado motion.
