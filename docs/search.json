While the drone is hovering in mid-air the user pulls it down to provide an initial displacement, and the drone starts oscillating with a frequency determined by the physical parameters of the mass-spring system. Similarly, multiple drones can be used to visualize standing and moving waves.\nJustin Rooney started this project as part of his M.Eng. thesis at the Cooper, PDF.\n\nThis project is now continued as a VIP course. Students Aymane Saissi, Amelia Chan, and Jason Chen, implemented a swarming drones demo that visualizes a tornado motion."

The navigation aspect involves constructing a city-like environment within the Vicon system and enabling the Create3 robot to navigate through it, avoiding obstacles and reaching a specified destination. In the physical systems modeling aspect, the goal is to input mathematical equations representing systems and have the Create3 robot follow the corresponding paths. David Guo, Will Wu, Eric Xu, and David Yang are currently working as part of a VIP course to integrate various functions demonstrated in the video into a cohesive and operational system."

In this paper, various leg\n    configurations for attenuating impact of airborne landings were\n    studied and tested. Using simple lumped element models for\n    simulation and analysis, a quadruped robot with a three-segment leg\n    was designed and built. This model was validated with experiments\n    with a small scale 20 cm-tall test robot. During the experiments,\n    the test robot experienced 7.7 \\$\\textbackslash times\\$ 10\n    m/s\\$\\^{}2\\$ or 7.9 g-acceleration when dropped from height of 37.85\n    cm.

Automation of intended motion is the desired goal. This\n    paper researches the motion of an ROV induced by the motion of the\n    robotic manipulators, motor torques, and added mass of fluid. This\n    project builds upon a previous project that had one robotic arm;\n    this time, there are two, but the method is unchanged. Furthermore,\n    this work explores both the patterns in addressing such challenges,\n    and an improved integration scheme. This research uses the Moving\n    Frame Method (MFM) to carry out this project. In fact, this paper\n    demonstrates the ease with which the MFM is extensible. Notable is\n    that this work represents an international collaboration between an\n    engineering school in Norway and one in the US. This work invites\n    further research into improved numerical methods, solid/fluid\n    interaction and the design of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).\n    AUVs beckon an era of Artificial Intelligence when machines think,\n    communicate and learn.
